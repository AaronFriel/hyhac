A HyperDex Haskell Client

What is HyperDex? [HyperDex.org](http://hyperdex.org) describes it so:

> HyperDex is a next generation key-value store with a wide array of features. HyperDex may be a good fit for you if your application needs to:
> 
> * Store rich datatypes such as strings, integers, floats, lists, maps, and sets.
> * Search and retrieve objects efficiently by secondary attributes.
> * Ensure that your data is up to date at all times with strong consistency guarantees.
> * Protect your data against a configurable number of simultaneous failures.
> * Perform atomic transactions over multiple objects, in a fast, scalable NoSQL data store.
> 
> HyperDex's key features -- namely its rich API, strong consistency, and fault tolerance -- provide strong guarantees to applications that are not matched by other NoSQL systems.
